# Seva Booking Application

I built this web application using **React.js** and **Redux** that allows users to browse, book, and pay for various sevas. It includes cart management, user verification with OTP, address validation using pincodes, and payment methods (Card & UPI).

---

## Features

* **Seva Listings** â€“ Browse and select sevas to book.
        *---[Seva Listings â€“ The documentation suggested fetching sevas from a backend API, but since it wasnâ€™t ready, I created a mock object containing the seva data. I then used the fetch() method to simulate retrieving this data and display the sevas for users to browse and select.]
  
* **Cart Management** â€“ Add, remove, and review selected sevas.
* **User Verification** â€“ Secure OTP-based flow for existing and new users.
* **Address Validation** â€“ Autofill city and state using pincode validation.  
       *---[Since no backend service was available for pincode lookup, I created a small mock Pincodes object in the frontend. When the user enters a valid 6-digit pincode, the app looks it up in this object and automatically fills in the corresponding city and state fields. If the pincode isnâ€™t found, an error message is shown and the fields stay empty.]
* **Payment Modal** â€“ Supports Card and UPI payment options.
* **State Management** â€“ Powered by Redux for seamless user and cart data flow.
* **Navigation** â€“ Smooth routing using `react-router`.
